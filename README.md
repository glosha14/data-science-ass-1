Web Traffic Visualization

This project analyzes and visualizes visitors by different web traffic sources (Searches, Direct, and Social Media) over time.  
The data is represented using a grouped bar chart.

Visualization
The Python script (`make_viz.py`) generates a chart saved as `visitors_by_source.png`:

- X-axis → Months (July to November 2019)  
- Y-axis → Number of visitors (in thousands)  
- Bars → Represent traffic from **Searches**, **Direct**, and **Social Media**  
- Labels → Show the exact number of visitors on top of each bar
